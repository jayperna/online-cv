      details: |
        Investigated how early-life penicillin exposure affects the 
        development of inhibitory circuits and microglia in the sensory 
        region of the cerebral cortex as well as sensory processing 
        behaviors and maturation of microbiota
          - Developed fluorescent and DAB IHC protocols as well as wide field 
          imaging protocols to measure neuronal and glial density differences 
          between control and experimental conditions
          - Developed a fluorescent IHC protocol, a confocal imaging protocol, 
          as well as a semiautomated analysis pipeline in Bitplane Imaris to 
          measure morphological differences in microglia between control and 
          experimental conditions
          - Developed a semiautomated analysis pipeline in Bitplane Imaris to 
          measure differences in microglial cell dynamics between control and
          experimental conditions
          - Purified total RNA from cerebral cortex tissue, synthesized cDNA, 
          and performed RT-qPCRs to quantify differences in expression for a 
          number of genes between control and experimental conditions as well
          as between different timepoints in development
          - Purified bacterial DNA, developed and performed a 16S library 
          preparation protocol for Illumina 2x300bp MiSeq, and performed data 
          analysis to characterize differences between control and experimental
          conditions
          - Employed a number of behavioral assays (Open Field Maze, 
          Novel Object Recognition Test, Y Maze Spontaneous Alteration Test, 
          Acoustic Startle Reflex and Prepulse Inhibition Tests, Three-
          Chamber Social Approach Test) and developed analysis protocols 
          for measuring behavioral differences between control and experimental
          conditions
          - Performed data management, analysis (Shapiro-Wilks normality test, 
          Student’s t-test, 2-way ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney U test), and 
          visualization in Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism
          - Mentored undergraduate students, supported and collaborated with 
          other graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and PIs
          - Wrote, reviewed, and submitted grant proposals and manuscripts
          
    - role: Junior Specialist
      time: 2012 - 2014
      company: University of California, Santa Cruz
      details: |
       Investigated how fragile X syndrome affects the expression of cortical 
       transcriptomes and how fragile X syndrome astrocytes contribute to brain
       and behavior abnormalities
          - Purified total RNA from cerebral cortex tissue and developed a 
          sucrose gradient centrifugation protocol for purifying polysomes 
          and monosomes
          - Assayed and analyzed behavior
          - Analyzed dendritic spine dynamics
          - Performed western blots 
          
    - role: Postbaccalaureate Fellow
      time: 2011 - 2012
      company: National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD
      details: |
        Investigated the regulation and maintenance of the touch dome epithelium, 
        a structure composed of keratinocytes and Merkel cells that cumulatively 
        provide a sense of shapes and edges, and attempted to generate a novel 
        Merkel carcinoma mouse model
          - Performed fluorescent IHC and X-gal staining protocols to identify a 
          novel population of touch dome stem cells and demonstrated that nerve-
          derived Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is necessary to maintain them
          - Employed traditional restriction enzyme cloning techniques in an 
          effort to generate an oncogenic construct that would drive expression 
          of the large tumor antigen in mouse Merkel cells
